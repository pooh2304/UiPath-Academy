# Project Overview

Build an automation project using the Invoke Workflow File activity, variables, and arguments.

### Your task is to:

Build a simple interest calculator using different workflows and arguments. Steps can be broken down as follows: 

1. In the Main workflow, ask the user to enter the initial deposit amount and select the period using multiple-choice option. The period can be either 1, 3, or 5 years. Store the input in two variables. Create a third variable that will store the value of the final earnings. 
2. Create a new workflow to calculate the simple interest using the user inputs. The formula to calculate the interest can be Deposit Amount * Rate per year * Period chosen / 100. Set the Rate per year to 1.75 for all deposit periods. 
3. Pass the result back to Main.xaml and display on-screen the accumulated interest at the end of the period and the final deposit balance.

Output: Display a message box with the accumulated interest at the end of the period and the final deposit balance.
