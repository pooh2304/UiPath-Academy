#### Automation Implementation Process
- Capturing the 'as-is' and 'to-be' process steps (Business Analyst)
- Documenting the process steps (Solution Architect)
- Signing-off the PDD from Business Team (Project Manager)
- Designing the solution (Solution Architect)
- Developing the solution (Automation Developers)

Q. What are some automation best practices to consider when automating a project? Choose all applicable answers. <br>
**Workflow files, activities, arguments, and variables should have meaningful names, to accurately describe their usage throughout the project. <br>
Choosing the appropriate layout type for the process we are building (sequences, flowcharts, state machines). <br>
Using a Version Control System to easily manage project versioning and sharing the work of more developers. <br>**
Making sure that output files are deleted at the beginning of processes before running. <br>
**Using Upper Camel Case naming convention for workflows. <br>**

Q. How can we purposely pause the debugging process on an activity which may trigger execution issues? Choose one of the answers. <br>
**By right-clicking the activity, and selecting Toggle Breakpoint to add and enable the breakpoint. <br>**
By using the Step Out button from the Debug tab while debugging. <br>
By enabling the Highlight Elements function from the Debug tab before debugging. <br>
By using the Step Into button from the Debug tab while debugging. <br>
