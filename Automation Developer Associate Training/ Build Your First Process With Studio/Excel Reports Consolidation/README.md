# Project Overview
Build a new automation process that consolidates data from multiple Excel reports into one and creates a pivot table and chart.


## Business Scenario

Each day, ACME's Sales department receives reports from coffee shops in Excel format.
A dedicated member of the team extracts the data from each report, merges it into an Excel spreadsheet, and then creates a pivot table and a chart based on the merged data.

#### Business Requirements:
- Streamline the process by integrating data from multiple reports and creating a single dashboard view.
- Timely reporting allowing the Sales team to take decisions based on real time data.
- Improved data quality (automation will allow validation of the data from the coffee shops before it's merged and processed).
- If the number of shops increases, automation can be scalable to handle more data.
- Reduced manual effort.
- Risk mitigation (automating the process will reduce errors that could happen when copying and pasting the data manually).
